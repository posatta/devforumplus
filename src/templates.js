	"!!ROBLOX": `Hi,

Just to let you know, the correct capitalization of 'ROBLOX' is Roblox. This is because Roblox is a proper noun, not an acronym.

ROBLOX was previously used, however this has changed; there are still some older sources which may use ROBLOX, however newer sources, including the [Roblox Name and Logo usage guidelines](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001708126-Roblox-Name-and-Logo-Community-Usage-Guidelines) use the newer 'Roblox' capitalization.

To answer the inevitable question, yes, the logo is written 'ROBLOX', however the wordmark does not equate to the capitalization in text; e.g. Discord's logo is written as 'DISCORD'. You can find similar things with a number of brands.

Feel free to ask me any further questions you may have about this.`,

Even though it is upsetting that you had a bad experience with this person, [calling other users out is against the Official Rules of the Roblox Developer Forum.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/official-rules-of-the-roblox-developer-forum/46429/9)

Calling out others is not allowed publicly, if you need to solve a dispute, please send them a DM. If they are claiming others work as their own, flag the post instead of replying. Failing to do so could result in strikes being issues against your account.

    "!!LUA": `Hi! 

It looks like you've written "LUA". Lua is not an acronym (or an initialism) - it is the Portuguese word for 'moon'. 

Fun fact: Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. See here for more info: https://www.lua.org/about.html`
