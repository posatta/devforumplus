        "!!VMLUAU": `Hey!

Looks like you wrote "LUAU"! Luau is not an acronym (or an initialism) - it's actually based on the language Luau is derived from, "Lua", which is also the Portuguese word for "moon".
Fun fact: Despite sharing the same spelling, Luau's naming is not based on the Hawaiian feast of the same name.`,

	"!!ROBLOX": `Hi,

Just to let you know, the correct capitalization of 'ROBLOX' is Roblox. This is because Roblox is a proper noun, not an acronym.

ROBLOX was previously used, however this has changed; there are still some older sources which may use ROBLOX, however newer sources, including the [Roblox Name and Logo usage guidelines](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001708126-Roblox-Name-and-Logo-Community-Usage-Guidelines) use the newer 'Roblox' capitalization.

To answer the inevitable question, yes, the logo is written 'ROBLOX', however the wordmark does not equate to the capitalization in text; e.g. Discord's logo is written as 'DISCORD'. You can find similar things with a number of brands.

Feel free to ask me any further questions you may have about this.`,

	"!!LUA": `Hi!

It looks like you've written "LUA". Lua is not an acronym (or an initialism) - it is the Portuguese word for 'moon'. 

Fun fact: Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. See here for more info: https://www.lua.org/about.html`,

	"!!WRONGTOPIC": `Hello,

It looks like you wrote that you weren't sure what the correct category is for your topic. According to @colbert2677, [You can ask Community Editors if you aren't sure what the correct category is.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/you-can-ask-community-editors-for-help-picking-a-category-if-you-dont-know-where-your-thread-belongs/830798)

I hope this helps clear any confusion!`
